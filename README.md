# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

Nothing much to add here, I just want to start my journey in the FrontEnd world.

I started with basic asp.net pages using bootstrap but with no full control on how to customize pages.

Next, due to new job, I started working on VueJS with Vuetify components and tailwindCSS and I really enjoyed understanding how each class affect the elements

But I wanted to go further with that, maybe more than further, the correct way of learning and working. Starting with pure CSS just to fully understand how everything works.

This approach is the first of many (I hope!) challenges that I wanna take in order to improve my CSS knowledge, I do understand that some code could be improve or good practices like not applying styles directly to HMTL tags should be avoid, but I just simply wanna go this way this time.

And, to the be the first from scratch challenge, I feel really proud.
